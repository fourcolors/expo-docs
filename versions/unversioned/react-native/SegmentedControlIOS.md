## SegmentedControlIOS

Use `SegmentedControlIOS` to render a UISegmentedControl iOS.

#### Programmatically changing selected index

The selected index can be changed on the fly by assigning the
selectIndex prop to a state variable, then changing that variable.
Note that the state variable would need to be updated as the user
selects a value and changes the index, as shown in the example below.

    <SegmentedControlIOS
      values={['One', 'Two']}
      selectedIndex={this.state.selectedIndex}
      onChange={(event) => {
        this.setState({selectedIndex: event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex});
      }}
    />

## values

The labels for the control's segment buttons, in order.

## selectedIndex

The index in `props.values` of the segment to be (pre)selected.

## onValueChange

Callback that is called when the user taps a segment;
passes the segment's value as an argument

## onChange

Callback that is called when the user taps a segment;
passes the event as an argument

## enabled

If false the user won't be able to interact with the control.
Default value is true.

## tintColor

Accent color of the control.

## momentary

If true, then selecting a segment won't persist visually.
The `onValueChange` callback will still work as expected.
