## set

This should only be called from native code by sending the
didUpdateDimensions event.

**Parameters**

-   `dims` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** Simple string-keyed object of dimensions to set

Returns **void** 

## get

Initial dimensions are set before `runApplication` is called so they should
be available before any other require's are run, but may be updated later.

Note: Although dimensions are available immediately, they may change (e.g
due to device rotation) so any rendering logic or styles that depend on
these constants should try to call this function on every render, rather
than caching the value (for example, using inline styles rather than
setting a value in a `StyleSheet`).

Example: `var {height, width} = Dimensions.get('window');`

**Parameters**

-   `dim` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Name of dimension as defined when calling `set`.

Returns **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)?** Value for the dimension.

## addEventListener

Add an event handler. Supported events:

-   `change`: Fires when a property within the `Dimensions` object changes. The argument
    to the event handler is an object with `window` and `screen` properties whose values
    are the same as the return values of `Dimensions.get('window')` and
    `Dimensions.get('screen')`, respectively.

**Parameters**

-   `type` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** 
-   `handler` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** 

## removeEventListener

Remove an event handler.

**Parameters**

-   `type` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** 
-   `handler` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)**
