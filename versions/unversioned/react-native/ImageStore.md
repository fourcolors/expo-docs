## hasImageForTag

Check if the ImageStore contains image data for the specified URI.

**Parameters**

-   `uri` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** 
-   `callback` **function (hasImage: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)): void** 

## removeImageForTag

Delete an image from the ImageStore. Images are stored in memory and
must be manually removed when you are finished with them, otherwise they
will continue to use up RAM until the app is terminated. It is safe to
call `removeImageForTag()` without first calling `hasImageForTag()`, it
will simply fail silently.

**Parameters**

-   `uri` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** 

## addImageFromBase64

Stores a base64-encoded image in the ImageStore, and returns a URI that
can be used to access or display the image later. Images are stored in
memory only, and must be manually deleted when you are finished with
them by calling `removeImageForTag()`.

Note that it is very inefficient to transfer large quantities of binary
data between JS and native code, so you should avoid calling this more
than necessary.

**Parameters**

-   `base64ImageData` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** 
-   `success` **function (uri: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)): void** 
-   `failure` **function (error: any): void** 

## getBase64ForTag

Retrieves the base64-encoded data for an image in the ImageStore. If the
specified URI does not match an image in the store, the failure callback
will be called.

Note that it is very inefficient to transfer large quantities of binary
data between JS and native code, so you should avoid calling this more
than necessary. To display an image in the ImageStore, you can just pass
the URI to an `<Image/>` component; there is no need to retrieve the
base64 data.

**Parameters**

-   `uri` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** 
-   `success` **function (base64ImageData: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)): void** 
-   `failure` **function (error: any): void**
