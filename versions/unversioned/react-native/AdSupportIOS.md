## AdSupportIOS

`AdSupport` provides access to the "advertising identifier". If you link this library
in your project, you may need to justify your use for this identifier when submitting
your application to the App Store.

In order to use `AdSupport` in your project, you must link the `RCTAdSupport` library.
In Xcode, you can manually add the `RCTAdSupport.m` and `RCTAdSupport.h` files from
`node_modules/react-native/Libraries/AdSupport/` to the `Libraries/React/Base/` folder
of your current project.

You can refer to [Linking](docs/linking-libraries-ios.html) for help.
