## DatePickerIOS

Use `DatePickerIOS` to render a date/time picker (selector) on iOS.  This is
a controlled component, so you must hook in to the `onDateChange` callback
and update the `date` prop in order for the component to update, otherwise
the user's change will be reverted immediately to reflect `props.date` as the
source of truth.

## date

The currently selected date.

## onDateChange

Date change handler.

This is called when the user changes the date or time in the UI.
The first and only argument is a Date object representing the new
date and time.

## maximumDate

Maximum date.

Restricts the range of possible date/time values.

## minimumDate

Minimum date.

Restricts the range of possible date/time values.

## mode

The date picker mode.

## minuteInterval

The interval at which minutes can be selected.

## timeZoneOffsetInMinutes

Timezone offset in minutes.

By default, the date picker will use the device's timezone. With this
parameter, it is possible to force a certain timezone offset. For
instance, to show times in Pacific Standard Time, pass -7 \* 60.
