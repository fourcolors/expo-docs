## Image

A React component for displaying different types of images,
including network images, static resources, temporary local images, and
images from local disk, such as the camera roll.

This example shows both fetching and displaying an image from local
storage as well as one from network.

```ReactNativeWebPlayer
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, View, Image } from 'react-native';

class DisplayAnImage extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Image
          source={require('./img/favicon.png')}
        />
        <Image
          style={{width: 50, height: 50}}
          source={{uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

// App registration and rendering
AppRegistry.registerComponent('DisplayAnImage', () => DisplayAnImage);
```

You can also add `style` to an image:

```ReactNativeWebPlayer
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, View, Image, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  stretch: {
    width: 50,
    height: 200
  }
});

class DisplayAnImageWithStyle extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Image
          style={styles.stretch}
          source={require('./img/favicon.png')}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

// App registration and rendering
AppRegistry.registerComponent(
  'DisplayAnImageWithStyle',
  () => DisplayAnImageWithStyle
);
```

### GIF and WebP support on Android

By default, GIF and WebP are not supported on Android.

You will need to add some optional modules in `android/app/build.gradle`, depending on the needs of your app.

    dependencies {
      // If your app supports Android versions before Ice Cream Sandwich (API level 14)
      compile 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-base-support:1.0.1'

      // For animated GIF support
      compile 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-gif:1.0.1'

      // For WebP support, including animated WebP
      compile 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-webp:1.0.1'
      compile 'com.facebook.fresco:webpsupport:1.0.1'

      // For WebP support, without animations
      compile 'com.facebook.fresco:webpsupport:1.0.1'
    }

Also, if you use GIF with ProGuard, you will need to add this rule in `proguard-rules.pro` :

    -keep class com.facebook.imagepipeline.animated.factory.AnimatedFactoryImpl {
      public AnimatedFactoryImpl(com.facebook.imagepipeline.bitmaps.PlatformBitmapFactory, com.facebook.imagepipeline.core.ExecutorSupplier);
    }

## style

> `ImageResizeMode` is an `Enum` for different image resizing modes, set via the
> `resizeMode` style property on `Image` components. The values are `contain`, `cover`,
> `stretch`, `center`, `repeat`.

## source

The image source (either a remote URL or a local file resource).

This prop can also contain several remote URLs, specified together with
their width and height and potentially with scale/other URI arguments.
The native side will then choose the best `uri` to display based on the
measured size of the image container. A `cache` property can be added to
control how networked request interacts with the local cache.

## defaultSource

A static image to display while loading the image source.

-   `uri` - a string representing the resource identifier for the image, which
    should be either a local file path or the name of a static image resource
    (which should be wrapped in the `require('./path/to/image.png')` function).
-   `width`, `height` - can be specified if known at build time, in which case
    these will be used to set the default `<Image/>` component dimensions.
-   `scale` - used to indicate the scale factor of the image. Defaults to 1.0 if
    unspecified, meaning that one image pixel equates to one display point / DIP.
-   `number` - Opaque type returned by something like `require('./image.jpg')`.

## accessible

When true, indicates the image is an accessibility element.

## accessibilityLabel

The text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with
the image.

## blurRadius

blurRadius: the blur radius of the blur filter added to the image

## capInsets

When the image is resized, the corners of the size specified
by `capInsets` will stay a fixed size, but the center content and borders
of the image will be stretched.  This is useful for creating resizable
rounded buttons, shadows, and other resizable assets.  More info in the
[official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImage_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIImage/resizableImageWithCapInsets).

## resizeMethod

The mechanism that should be used to resize the image when the image's dimensions
differ from the image view's dimensions. Defaults to `auto`.

-   `auto`: Use heuristics to pick between `resize` and `scale`.

-   `resize`: A software operation which changes the encoded image in memory before it
    gets decoded. This should be used instead of `scale` when the image is much larger
    than the view.

-   `scale`: The image gets drawn downscaled or upscaled. Compared to `resize`, `scale` is
    faster (usually hardware accelerated) and produces higher quality images. This
    should be used if the image is smaller than the view. It should also be used if the
    image is slightly bigger than the view.

More details about `resize` and `scale` can be found at <http://frescolib.org/docs/resizing-rotating.html>.

## resizeMode

Determines how to resize the image when the frame doesn't match the raw
image dimensions.

-   `cover`: Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio)
    so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal
    to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).

-   `contain`: Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio)
    so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to
    or less than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).

-   `stretch`: Scale width and height independently, This may change the
    aspect ratio of the src.

-   `repeat`: Repeat the image to cover the frame of the view. The
    image will keep it's size and aspect ratio. (iOS only)

## testID

A unique identifier for this element to be used in UI Automation
testing scripts.

## onLayout

Invoked on mount and layout changes with
`{nativeEvent: {layout: {x, y, width, height}}}`.

## onLoadStart

Invoked on load start.

e.g., `onLoadStart={(e) => this.setState({loading: true})}`

## onProgress

Invoked on download progress with `{nativeEvent: {loaded, total}}`.

## onError

Invoked on load error with `{nativeEvent: {error}}`.

## onPartialLoad

Invoked when a partial load of the image is complete. The definition of
what constitutes a "partial load" is loader specific though this is meant
for progressive JPEG loads.

## onLoad

Invoked when load completes successfully.

## onLoadEnd

Invoked when load either succeeds or fails.

## getSize

Retrieve the width and height (in pixels) of an image prior to displaying it.
This method can fail if the image cannot be found, or fails to download.

In order to retrieve the image dimensions, the image may first need to be
loaded or downloaded, after which it will be cached. This means that in
principle you could use this method to preload images, however it is not
optimized for that purpose, and may in future be implemented in a way that
does not fully load/download the image data. A proper, supported way to
preload images will be provided as a separate API.

Does not work for static image resources.

**Parameters**

-   `uri` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The location of the image.
-   `success` **function (width: [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number), height: [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)): void** The function that will be called if the image was successfully found and width
    and height retrieved.
-   `failure` **function (error: any): void** The function that will be called if there was an error, such as failing to
    to retrieve the image.

Returns **any** void

## prefetch

Prefetches a remote image for later use by downloading it to the disk
cache

**Parameters**

-   `url` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The remote location of the image.

Returns **any** The prefetched image.

## resolveAssetSource

Resolves an asset reference into an object which has the properties `uri`, `width`,
and `height`. The input may either be a number (opaque type returned by
require('./foo.png')) or an `ImageSource` like { uri: '&lt;http location || file path>' }

## viewConfig

`NativeMethodsMixin` will look for this when invoking `setNativeProps`. We
make `this` look like an actual native component class.
