## WebView

**Extends React.Component**

`WebView` renders web content in a native view.

    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import { WebView } from 'react-native';

    class MyWeb extends Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <WebView
            source={{uri: 'https://github.com/facebook/react-native'}}
            style={{marginTop: 20}}
          />
        );
      }
    }

You can use this component to navigate back and forth in the web view's
history and configure various properties for the web content.

### goForward

Go forward one page in the web view's history.

### goBack

Go back one page in the web view's history.

### reload

Reloads the current page.

### stopLoading

Stop loading the current page.

### postMessage

Posts a message to the web view, which will emit a `message` event.
Accepts one argument, `data`, which must be a string.

In your webview, you'll need to something like the following.

```js
document.addEventListener('message', e => { document.title = e.data; });
```

### injectJavaScript

Injects a javascript string into the referenced WebView. Deliberately does not
return a response because using eval() to return a response breaks this method
on pages with a Content Security Policy that disallows eval(). If you need that
functionality, look into postMessage/onMessage.

### \_updateNavigationState

We return an event with a bunch of fields including:
 url, title, loading, canGoBack, canGoForward

### getWebViewHandle

Returns the native `WebView` node.

## source

Loads static html or a uri (with optional headers) in the WebView.

## renderError

Function that returns a view to show if there's an error.

## renderLoading

Function that returns a loading indicator.

## onLoad

Function that is invoked when the `WebView` has finished loading.

## onLoadEnd

Function that is invoked when the `WebView` load succeeds or fails.

## onLoadStart

Function that is invoked when the `WebView` starts loading.

## onError

Function that is invoked when the `WebView` load fails.

## bounces

Boolean value that determines whether the web view bounces
when it reaches the edge of the content. The default value is `true`.

## decelerationRate

A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view
decelerates after the user lifts their finger. You may also use the
string shortcuts `"normal"` and `"fast"` which match the underlying iOS
settings for `UIScrollViewDecelerationRateNormal` and
`UIScrollViewDecelerationRateFast` respectively:

-   normal: 0.998
-   fast: 0.99 (the default for iOS web view)

## scrollEnabled

Boolean value that determines whether scrolling is enabled in the
`WebView`. The default value is `true`.

## automaticallyAdjustContentInsets

Controls whether to adjust the content inset for web views that are
placed behind a navigation bar, tab bar, or toolbar. The default value
is `true`.

## contentInset

The amount by which the web view content is inset from the edges of
the scroll view. Defaults to {top: 0, left: 0, bottom: 0, right: 0}.

## onNavigationStateChange

Function that is invoked when the `WebView` loading starts or ends.

## onMessage

A function that is invoked when the webview calls `window.postMessage`.
Setting this property will inject a `postMessage` global into your
webview, but will still call pre-existing values of `postMessage`.

`window.postMessage` accepts one argument, `data`, which will be
available on the event object, `event.nativeEvent.data`. `data`
must be a string.

## startInLoadingState

Boolean value that forces the `WebView` to show the loading view
on the first load.

## style

The style to apply to the `WebView`.

## dataDetectorTypes

Determines the types of data converted to clickable URLs in the web viewâ€™s content.
By default only phone numbers are detected.

You can provide one type or an array of many types.

Possible values for `dataDetectorTypes` are:

-   `'phoneNumber'`
-   `'link'`
-   `'address'`
-   `'calendarEvent'`
-   `'none'`
-   `'all'`

## javaScriptEnabled

Boolean value to enable JavaScript in the `WebView`. Used on Android only
as JavaScript is enabled by default on iOS. The default value is `true`.

## domStorageEnabled

Boolean value to control whether DOM Storage is enabled. Used only in
Android.

## injectedJavaScript

Set this to provide JavaScript that will be injected into the web page
when the view loads.

## userAgent

Sets the user-agent for the `WebView`.

## scalesPageToFit

Boolean that controls whether the web content is scaled to fit
the view and enables the user to change the scale. The default value
is `true`.

## onShouldStartLoadWithRequest

Function that allows custom handling of any web view requests. Return
`true` from the function to continue loading the request and `false`
to stop loading.

## allowsInlineMediaPlayback

Boolean that determines whether HTML5 videos play inline or use the
native full-screen controller. The default value is `false`.

**NOTE** : In order for video to play inline, not only does this
property need to be set to `true`, but the video element in the HTML
document must also include the `webkit-playsinline` attribute.

## mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction

Boolean that determines whether HTML5 audio and video requires the user
to tap them before they start playing. The default value is `true`.

## injectJavaScript

Function that accepts a string that will be passed to the WebView and
executed immediately as JavaScript.

## mixedContentMode

Specifies the mixed content mode. i.e WebView will allow a secure origin to load content from any other origin.

Possible values for `mixedContentMode` are:

-   `'never'` (default) - WebView will not allow a secure origin to load content from an insecure origin.
-   `'always'` - WebView will allow a secure origin to load content from any other origin, even if that origin is insecure.
-   `'compatibility'` -  WebView will attempt to be compatible with the approach of a modern web browser with regard to mixed content.
