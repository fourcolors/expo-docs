## Switch

Renders a boolean input.

This is a controlled component that requires an `onValueChange` callback that
updates the `value` prop in order for the component to reflect user actions.
If the `value` prop is not updated, the component will continue to render
the supplied `value` prop instead of the expected result of any user actions.

## value

The value of the switch.  If true the switch will be turned on.
Default value is false.

## disabled

If true the user won't be able to toggle the switch.
Default value is false.

## onValueChange

Invoked with the new value when the value changes.

## testID

Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.

## tintColor

Border color on iOS and background color on Android when the switch is turned off.

## onTintColor

Background color when the switch is turned on.

## thumbTintColor

Color of the foreground switch grip.
