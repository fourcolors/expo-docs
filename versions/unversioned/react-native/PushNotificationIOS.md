## PushNotificationEventName

An event emitted by PushNotificationIOS.

Type: $Enum&lt;{notification: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), localNotification: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), register: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), registrationError: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)}>

## notification

Fired when a remote notification is received. The handler will be invoked
with an instance of `PushNotificationIOS`.

## localNotification

Fired when a local notification is received. The handler will be invoked
with an instance of `PushNotificationIOS`.

## register

Fired when the user registers for remote notifications. The handler will be
invoked with a hex string representing the deviceToken.

## registrationError

Fired when the user fails to register for remote notifications. Typically
occurs when APNS is having issues, or the device is a simulator. The
handler will be invoked with {message: string, code: number, details: any}.

Handle push notifications for your app, including permission handling and
icon badge number.

To get up and running, [configure your notifications with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AddingCapabilities/AddingCapabilities.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH26-SW6)
and your server-side system.

[Manually link](docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#manual-linking) the PushNotificationIOS library

-   Add the following to your Project: `node_modules/react-native/Libraries/PushNotificationIOS/RCTPushNotification.xcodeproj`
-   Add the following to `Link Binary With Libraries`: `libRCTPushNotification.a`

Finally, to enable support for `notification` and `register` events you need to augment your AppDelegate.

At the top of your `AppDelegate.m`:

  `#import <React/RCTPushNotificationManager.h>`

And then in your AppDelegate implementation add the following:

     // Required to register for notifications
     - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:(UIUserNotificationSettings *)notificationSettings
     {
      [RCTPushNotificationManager didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
     }
     // Required for the register event.
     - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken
     {
      [RCTPushNotificationManager didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
     }
     // Required for the notification event. You must call the completion handler after handling the remote notification.
     - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
                                                            fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler
     {
       [RCTPushNotificationManager didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
     }
     // Required for the registrationError event.
     - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error
     {
      [RCTPushNotificationManager didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:error];
     }
     // Required for the localNotification event.
     - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification
     {
      [RCTPushNotificationManager didReceiveLocalNotification:notification];
     }

**Parameters**

-   `nativeNotif` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** 

### constructor

You will never need to instantiate `PushNotificationIOS` yourself.
Listening to the `notification` event and invoking
`getInitialNotification` is sufficient

**Parameters**

-   `nativeNotif` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** 

### finish

This method is available for remote notifications that have been received via:
`application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:`
<https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIApplicationDelegate/application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler>:

Call this to execute when the remote notification handling is complete. When
calling this block, pass in the fetch result value that best describes
the results of your operation. You _must_ call this handler and should do so
as soon as possible. For a list of possible values, see `PushNotificationIOS.FetchResult`.

If you do not call this method your background remote notifications could
be throttled, to read more about it see the above documentation link.

**Parameters**

-   `fetchResult` **FetchResult**

-   `localNotification` : Fired when a local notification is received. The
    handler will be invoked with an instance of `PushNotificationIOS`.

### requestPermissions

Requests notification permissions from iOS, prompting the user's

a subset of these can be requested by passing a map of requested
permissions.
The following permissions are supported:

-   `alert`
-   `badge`
-   `sound`

If a map is provided to the method, only the permissions with truthy values
will be requested.

This method returns a promise that will resolve when the user accepts,
rejects, or if the permissions were previously rejected. The promise
resolves to the current state of the permission.

**Parameters**

-   `permissions` **{alert: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)?, badge: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)?, sound: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)?}**

### abandonPermissions

Unregister for all remote notifications received via Apple Push Notification service.

You should call this method in rare circumstances only, such as when a new version of

prevent apps from receiving remote notifications through the Notifications section of
the Settings app. Apps unregistered through this method can always re-register.

### checkPermissions

See what push permissions are currently enabled. `callback` will be
invoked with a `permissions` object:

-   `badge` :boolean
-   `sound` :boolean

**Parameters**

object if the app was launched by a push notification, or `null` otherwise.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;[PushNotificationIOS](#pushnotificationios)?>**
